![My Motivations](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-frustration%20%F0%9F%98%8B-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)

A mobile app for making spontaneous lunch get-togethers with friends easier. 

Being built with Firebase and React Native.

## Things to Note
The Android and iOS config files for the LunchMe Firebase backend have been
.gitignored and hence aren't part of this repo. If you want to connect this
code to your own backend, follow these instructions for [Android](https://invertase.io/oss/react-native-firebase/quick-start/android-firebase-credentials) and [iOS](https://invertase.io/oss/react-native-firebase/quick-start/ios-firebase-credentials).

This project uses CocoaPods.
